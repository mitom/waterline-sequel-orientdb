Waterline-Sequel-OrientDB
=========================

A helper library for generating OrientDB SQL queries from the Waterline Query Language.

## Overview

This is an adaptation of [waterline-sequel](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline-sequel) (written by [Cody Stoltman](https://github.com/particlebanana)) to output OrientDB style SQL and is used by [waterline-orientdb](https://github.com/appscot/waterline-orientdb) adapter.

## What this is not

This is not a comprehensive adaptation of `waterline-sequel` but rather the minimum required to satisfy `waterline-orientdb` needs. If you encounter an edge case where you don't get the expected output please report it in the [Issues](https://github.com/appscot/waterline-sequel-orientdb/issues) section.
